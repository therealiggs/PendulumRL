# PendulumRL
This is a repo for my and Michael Dorosh's university project, which is a basic introduction to reinforcement learning.
We've examined an algorythm for the swingup pendulum problem provided by https://github.com/philtabor, and have created a presentation to share the progress with our co-students.

Please notice: the code in this repo is barely changed from the orginal (https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository), so it fully belongs to Mr. Phil Tabor.
The product we've created is the presentation (ddpg_rl_1.pptx)
